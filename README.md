## Overview


### Screenshot

![image](./finalScreen.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Flexbox, Grid)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Agnostic framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - -For ate state management


### What I learned

I started the challenge of replicating the rock paper scissors game in order to practice a little tailwind, and learn the use of Astro with zustand, I was surprised by the impact on performance when performing the application with Astro, and the use of zustand to manage the state was particularly easy, I can't wait to do another project with the same stack.
